# QRS_detector

  Implemented real-time QRS detection algorithm in Matlab. The algorithm is based on [Chen's article](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260705002592). The QRS
  filter is designed based on a simple moving average filter. The results of testing are
  97% of sensitivity and 98% of positive predictivity on [ltst database](https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/ltstdb/).
